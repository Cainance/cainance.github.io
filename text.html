                            This is a work-in-progress, minimalistic, MMORPG, built on top 
                            of the most bleeding edge technology available. The game is 
                            being written in C, without any use of standard libraries 
                            or external dependencies. I'm restricting myself to C89, 
                            without any exceptions. The only thing being used as of this date 
                            is the stdarg.h implementation, provided by the clang compiler,
                            but this will hopefully not be the case for long. The game is
                            utilizing bleeding edge technology such as WebRTC for its
                            network implementation. In order to establish a connection,
                            the game will use WebSockets, as implemented by Javascript, to
                            securely establish a connection to initiate the WebRTC connection.
                            The WebSocket Server is written with the same quality as everything else,
                            from scratch, C89, Windows and Linux support, no dependencies. Same
                            goes for the WebRTC Server. Clang is used for compilation. WebGL 
                            will be used for rendering, as this will allow the game to use the
                            full potential of the GPU. The goal of the project is to showcase 
                            my capabilities, whilst at the same time challenging myself. 
                            The game may or may not be successful, but I'll do everything 
                            in my power to ensure absolute perfection.
